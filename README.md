Attached is an example CSV for the formatting.

This is run through a command line prompt of the base image to be edited, the previously calculated locations of the ports, and the actual port details for each switch.
For example: python switch_ports.py --image "48 PORTS.png" --ports "48ports.csv" --switch_csv "CServerRoom.csv"
This will output an image in the directory of the python file.
